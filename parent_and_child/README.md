The code "parent_and_child.py" builds multiple parent creatures based on input parameters and tests them individually on their final x-position in space. The creature that has moved the farthest in the x-direction at the end of the simulation is chosen to have the highest fitness and is simulated with a viewport. Additionally, the trajectory of the best parent creature over the simulation time is projected on the XY plane and plotted. Then the best parent is mutated by randomly adding limbs. These children are then tested individually on their motion and final x-position in space. The child creature that has moved the farthest in the x-direction at the end of the simulation is chosen to have the highest fitness and is simulated with a viewport.
