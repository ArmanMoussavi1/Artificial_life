The code "creator.py" simulates a randomly generated creature reminiscent of a jellyfish. Actuators automatically move its limbs to provide "life". The code writes and proceeds to simulate a .xml file titled "beginning_of_life", alluding to the beginning of this being's short life. The genotype for this being is displayed in "genotype_graph.png" and an example morphology is available in "creature_morphology.png".

Sorry for the messy code. In time it will be cleansed.
